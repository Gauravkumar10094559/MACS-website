<h1 class="orange">Why sponsor us?</h1>
<p>The Mathematics and Computing Society blooms in its fullest vigour at the  time of its annual techno-cultural festival, <b>Asymptotes</b>.  Attended by a flood of  students from engineering colleges across the country, the mega event registers attendees in an enormous amount. Such a lively environment brings with it, amazing opportunities for promotion and advertisement.<br> Separate stalls for our sponsors are arranged around the lawns and lobbies. They act as magnets for students who wish to know more about the companies and the services which may benefit them.  And indeed, the students never get enough of it. The 'food joints' of our catering partners have been all-time crowd pullers for the trencherman in each. Besides these, we invite our sponsors to show their promotional presentations in the middle of popular events which guarantee them a packed auditorium. The space we provide to our sponsors in the posters and hoardings is visible in the various colleges in Delhi and the NCR region. And finally, our media partners leave no stone unturned while publicizing our sponsors in general public or corporate lobbies via radio, internet or print media.</p>
